# Boilermaker

## Typos

## Errors

- **React > Start Script:** example dropdown has naked markdown denoting a js code block inside `<p>` tags instead.

## Suggestions

- **React > Index JS:** Might be useful to link to the first page of the **Express** section.
- **React > Dev Dependencies:** Throw `nodemon` in as part of the dev depends to enable smoother start scripts section. After all, it's mentioned in the `start-dev` script.
- **Express > Static Middleware:** Might be useful to remind us to define and require `path`.
